# House-SalePrice-Prediction
A machine learning regression module which uses regression techniques to predict the selling price of a house 

This dataset contains many features which include categorical as well as numerical data.
Before training the model we have to convert the categorical data into numerical data. Here I have used one hot encoding method to convert the categorical features into numerical features.

After encoding the model is trained and tested.

The different algorithms used are Random Forest regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression, Light Gradient Boosting Regression and Stacking CV Regression.
